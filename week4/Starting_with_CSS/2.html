        <h2>About css</h2>
        <p>CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation and formatting of a document written in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). 
            It is a fundamental technology in web development that allows designers and developers to control the appearance of web pages.
            <br>
            CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. 
            These rules define how the elements should be displayed, such as their color, size, layout, and positioning. 
            By separating the presentation from the content, CSS enables the creation of consistent and visually appealing web pages.
            </p>
        <h2>some features of css are :-</h2>
            <p>
                1. <span> Selectors :-</span> Selectors are used to target specific HTML elements that you want to style. 
                They can be based on element names, class names, IDs, attributes, or other criteria.
                <br>
                <br>
                2. <span> Properties:-</span> CSS properties define the visual aspects of the selected elements. 
                Examples include color, font, margin, padding, border, background, and more. Each property has a value associated with it.
                <br>
                <br>
                3. <span> Values:- </span> Values are assigned to CSS properties and determine how the selected elements should appear. 
                For instance, the color property can have values like "red," "#000000" (hexadecimal representation), "rgb(255, 0, 0)" (RGB values), or "hsl(0, 100%, 50%)" (HSL values).
