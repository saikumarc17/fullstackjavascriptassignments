Improving the accessibility of HTML is crucial for ensuring that web content is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. Here are three ways to enhance HTML accessibility:

1) Using semantic in HTML : Sementic HTML involves using appropriate HTML elements to convey the meaning and structure of content .
                            By using elements like headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`), paragraphs (`<p>`), lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`), and others, you provide clear and meaningful information to assistive technologies such as screen readers. 
                            Using semantic HTML helps users navigate and understand the content more easily.

2) Providing alt text in images : poviding alt text in images will help to describe about the image to Screenreaders.
                                 It also help in displaying image description in case of image is not loaded properly

3)Implement Keyboard Accessibility: Many users rely on keyboard navigation instead of a mouse or other pointing devices. 
                                    It's essential to ensure that all interactive elements and functionality in your HTML can be accessed and operated using only a keyboard. 
                                    Properly manage focus styles, provide keyboard shortcuts, and use tabindex appropriately to ensure that keyboard users can navigate through the content and interact with form controls and other interactive elements.

4)Test with Assistive Technologies: To truly gauge the accessibility of your HTML content, it's important to test it using assistive technologies such as screen readers, magnifiers, or voice recognition software. 
                                    By simulating how users with disabilities interact with your website, you can identify any accessibility barriers or issues that need to be addressed. 
                                    These tests will help you validate the effectiveness of your accessibility enhancements and make further improvements if necessary.
